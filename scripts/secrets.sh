# same helper as the platform does (CONTRACT.md §4). Keep it in step with that file.
#
# Edit or inspect a SOPS-encrypted file, with sops in a container so nothing is installed
# on this Mac. Needs the age private key locally to decrypt; see SECRETS.md in gcloud-ovh-migrate.
#
# The editor runs inside the container, so it is the container's vi, not this Mac's
# $EDITOR — an EDITOR naming a Mac app would not exist in there. SECRETS_EDITOR=vim works
# too. A file that does not exist yet is created, encrypted on save to the recipients
# .sops.yaml names for its path.
#
# `set` is for one value, typically a token copied from a web page: it is read from a
# hidden prompt and never shown, never written to a file in the clear, and never put on a
# command line. sops edit, by contrast, keeps a plaintext copy in the container while vi
# has it open.
#
#   secrets.sh edit  path/to/file.enc.env
#   secrets.sh set   path/to/file.enc.env KEY  (value from a hidden prompt or stdin)
#   secrets.sh show  path/to/file.enc.env      (prints keys only, never values)
